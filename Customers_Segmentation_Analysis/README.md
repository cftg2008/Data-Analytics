# Customers_Segmentation_Analysis <h1>

### Overview <h3>

In the project, we are going to analyze the customers of TravelTide in their preferences of perks proposed by our Marketing team. Additionally, we will assign each customer in the cohort with the most likely perk favoured by the customer.

### Dataset structure <h3>

TravelTide stores its data in a PostgreSQL database with four main tables:
* Users - user demographic information
* Sessions - information about individual browsing sessions
* Flights - information purchased flights
* Hotels - information about purchased hotel stays

The task is to apply data analysis to validate the perks and assign customers to segments according to what we think their favourite perk is. Then provide recommendations to the TravelTide stakeholders.
