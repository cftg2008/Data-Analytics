Mastery Project 2:
# MS-NYC-Rental-Analysis

Overview

In this project, we are going to analyze the short-term rentals data in New York City for the startup Pillow Palooza. In addition, we will provide recommendations to the company's stakeholders so they can optimize their strategy of maximizing revenue and occupancy rates.

Datasets

Data are collected from both internal and public sources on rental listings in New York City. Pillow stores its data in a PostgreSQL database with three main tables:
   - Prices (price in dollars, name of neighborhood, GPS coordinates)
   - Reviews (host name, number of reviews, number of listings per host, number of days booked)
   - Room Types (room type, description)

The task is to analyze the rental data to come up with insights and recommendataions to those internal teams that are responsible for managing growth and success in the NYC market.
